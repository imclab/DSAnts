Concept:

Sim-Ants / DigDug style game created in a large disk, mario-galaxy style world.

Both red and black ants will share the same disk underground world

Initially the game will focus more on the under-ground aspect and building an impenetrable ant-cave and focus less on the above ground aspects.


Development process:

1. Create the 2D / circular underground world.
	- circular / 2d
	- destrutable, player

2. Create occupants
	- Player
	- Queen
	- Egg / Hatch system
	- Food / Eating system
	- Workers / Breeders / Soldiers

3. Create surface world
	- Terrain themes (outdoors, patio, kitchen, etc)
	- Obstacles (Rocks, pits, shoe)
	- Food
	- Enemies (Pincer pit, spider, food)

4. A.I. / Enemy base.
	- Food gathering
	- Play style (aggressive, defensive)
	- Base design



Underground world data structure.

The world is a flat donut, with an unpassable "rock" core at the bottom.
The donut is broken down into SLICES.
A slice is a logical entity which can be loaded in parts.
Slices are stitched together to adjacent slices
Each slice is loaded in entirety in such a way that only 2 slices need to be loaded at once for display purposes.
Each slice is a 2D array.  It does not taper out towards the bottom, as the bottom is "rock" it can be spoofed.

Each slice is broken down into squares which can be:
	-dirt (clearable)
	-cleared (walkable, objects may be placed, can be buried)
	-unpassable (i.e. rock)
